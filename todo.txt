- Refresh interval not working
   since render can take few seconds, get start time and then sleep remaining with 100ms intervals...

- URL should be in settings I guess? or a different file later on

- have multiple dashboard support potentially and cycle through them..

- fix slow exit, need a find a way to render in different thread that can be instantly interrupted..
